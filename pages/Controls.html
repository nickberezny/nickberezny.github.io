			Robustness Framework for Interaction Control
		</div>
		<div class="six columns">
			Interaction controllers are typically viewed from the perspective of causality: Impedance control is a torque-based controller, whereas Admittance control is a position-based controller. In this work I reframe interaction control in terms or robustness to modelling error and force sensor error. Interaction controllers are defined by sensitivity functions (S) to modelling error and force sensor error. The sensitivities are subject to the constraint:

			Therefore there is a a trade-off between robustness, and choosing an interaction controller is akin to an optimization problem. Many types of interaction controllers can thus be placed on a spectrum:

			Unified Interaction Control (UIC)
		</div>
		<div class="six columns">
			UIC is a generalization of UIAC and IM-IC. It alters a typical Admittance controller with an inner-loop gain weighting and a virtual state reset to interpolate across the IC/AC spectrum. This method also explains the effect of the reset, which is also found in UIAC and IM-IC. Interpolation can be understood as trading-off robustness to modelling error and force sensor error; or, simply as creating an output trajectory that is in-between IC and AC:

			Applications with Unavoidable Force Sensor Error
		</div>
		<div class="six columns">
			Here I applied the robustness perspective on interaction control for devices with inherent force sensor errors. Examples could include robot grasping, exoskeletons, though we do a case study with low-cost force sensors.

			Using UIC, optimal performance can be achieved by trading-off robustness. The optimal level of interpolation is ultimately dependent on the physical impedance of the robot and the accuracy of the dynamic model.

			Contact Stability with Industrial Robots
		</div>
		<div class="six columns">
			Here I applied interpolation to the problem of contact stability in industrial robots. To the extent that contact oscillations are caused by force sensor error (specifically, delay), they can be mitigated by interpolating to inject some robustness to this error. Experiments were carried out on a 6-DOF deburring robot.
