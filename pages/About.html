			I'm a Mechanical & Biomedical Engineer contributing to the field of robot interaction, from low-level control theory for dynamic interaction, to higher-level applications such as haptic feedback, adaptive controls, and rehabilitation robotics. Also interested in characterizing human physiological states using biosignals such as fatigue, stress, and limb stiffness for improved human-robot and human-machine interaction.
